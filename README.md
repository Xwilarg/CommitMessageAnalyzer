# GitHubCommitMessageAnalyzer
If you ever worked on a project with someone using Git, you probably met the hassle of pulling changes and not understanding what was modified because of terrible commit messages.<br/><br/>
I believe that commit message are really important when working with others people and that's why I made this project.<br/>
It goal is to analyse a GitHub/GitLab repository and tell every commit message that are "bad".<br/>
It analyse them following [these rules.](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)<br/><br/>
You can freely try it [here.](https://commits.zirk.eu/)<br/>
If you feel like something is wrong with how your repository was analyzed, feel free to [open an issue.](https://github.com/Xwilarg/CommitMessageAnalyzer/issues)<br/>
The list of verbs used for rule 5 is available [here.](https://files.zirk.eu/commits.zirk.eu/verbs.txt)
